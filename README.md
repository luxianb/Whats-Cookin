# Project 3 - Startup Week (What’s Cookin)

Deployment link: https://floating-basin-88540.herokuapp.com/

## What is your application? 

Essentially this app is where users can subscribe to a service where they can select different cuisines and recipes of their preference and follow along step by step with the recipes provided 

Users can also submit their own recipes that can be reviewed (based on a rating system) and can comment on them accordingly

Users will have their own profiles where they can 
Manage their recipes of choice, (what they are planning to cook etc) - Planner
Contribute their own ideas/recipes to the growing list of recipes on the app - My recipes
Settings - TBC (Maybe to update user info)

## What value does your application provide to your audience?
It's an avenue for users to explore different ideas to spice up their meals and share their own versions of recipes 
The individual recipes have clear and concise steps, each recipe also informs users of the estimated time it will take and a checklist of all the ingredients required (Perfect for users that are new to cooking)
 
## What steps have we taken to entice users?
Users can explore available meals submitted to the site, and use the guide function for the meal they have chosen. However to submit their own recipe, and to save their progress on the meal guide they would have to sign up for an account
